This Google Colab notebook contains the complete implementation of a Brain Tumor Detection System using machine learning techniques on MRI scan images.

The notebook includes:

Loading and preprocessing brain MRI images (resizing, normalization, data preparation).

Training a machine learning / deep learning model to classify MRI images as tumor or no-tumor.

Model evaluation, including accuracy and testing performance.

Use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow/Keras or Scikit-Learn in Colab.

Easy execution on Google Colab with GPU support for faster training
